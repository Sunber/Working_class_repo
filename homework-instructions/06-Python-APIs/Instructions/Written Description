Three observable trends that I have noticed from the graphs are as follows. 1, the closer that the latitude is to 0, then the higher the temperature in that area will be(Some temperatures apparently peaking out at over 300 degrees). 2, wind speeds seem to follow the opposite trend where the further from the latitude you are the greater the wind speed. And finally, the third thing that I have noticed in this series of graphs is that there does not seem to be any correlation between city lat and cloudiness, so there is probably no relation between the two.
