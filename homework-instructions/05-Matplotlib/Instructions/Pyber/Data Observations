Three observable trends from the data are that 1. Suburban cities are the most likely to generate the most revenue for this service because of the high demand for rides. 2. It is very like that despite the fact that the average fare for rural is much higher, it will continue to decline in number because the vast majority of people in America live in Urban or Suburban cities. And 3, the other flipside of the previous argument is that since suburban and urban areas are much more heavily populated, there will likely be stiff competition from other ride sharing services, so we must consider having locations in rural areas as they still generate a considerable rate per ride, and it would also save money by needing to hire fewer drivers.
